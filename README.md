<h1 align="center">Your Plan</h1>

<p align="center">When reading through the following chapters, take the time to observe the world 
and the technologies around to see if you can identify places where cryptographic 
technology may be used. This is a great exercise because it will get you in the right 
mindset to understand and possibly implement the technologies later, or at the very 
least be able to identify them in the software or hardware you purchase.</P>
