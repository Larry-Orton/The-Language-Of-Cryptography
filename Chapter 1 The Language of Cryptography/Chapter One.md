<h1 align="center"> Where Can Cryptography be Applied?</h1>
<p>We should think in terms of 
applications. Where can cryptography be applied, and why should we care? Well, the 
reality is that the knowledge is applied everywhere you look and frequently in places you 
would not even guess or be aware of. Some of the places where encryption is used range 
from the obvious to the not so obvious, as the following list shows:</p>

<ul> &#x2022; Hard drives</ul>
  <p>In today’s world, with the abundance of portable computing devices 
such as laptops that are easily stolen, drive encryption has become a large part of 
routine security in the mobile space. Many different products have arrived in the 
last few years that work to ensure that the thief cannot violate the confidentiality or 
integrity of the data.</p>

<ul> &#x2022; Digital signatures</ul>
  <P>More and more e-mails are being digitally signed to validate the 
identity of the sender and to ensure that the information is as the sender intended it to be.</P>

<ul> &#x2022; E-commerce</ul>
<P>More and more e-mails are being digitally signed to validate the 
identity of the sender and to ensure that the information is as the sender intended it to be.</p>

<ul> &#x2022; Cell phones</ul>
<P>Cell phones make widespread use of cryptographic technologies to 
authenticate devices as well as protect data and other items. Additionally, many 
financial transactions are now being completed via mobile devices such as tablets and 
smartphones. This makes cryptographic operations an integral daily activity for a vast 
number of customers.</p>

<h3>Cryptography</h3>
<p>The word <b>cryptography</b> comes to 
us by way of the Latin language and 
translates into English as “secret writing."</p>

<h3>Encryption:</h3><p>is a process that converts unencrypted information from a clear and open 
state to a secure and relatively protected state intended to keep the information safe from 
prying eyes.</p>
